## Lab1

Compile a family tree base in the Prolog language, indicating kinship, based on two primary facts: parent and spouse.

What should be included in the report:

1. Task
2. Picture of family tree
3. The knowledge base must consist of at least 50 facts and at least 10 rules
4. Results of checking facts and rules on examples.

## Lab2

Investigate different search algorithms  
Connectivity table between known undirected graph cities  
Stage 1. Uninformed search: (ignore path length)  

1. breadth-first search  
2. search depth  
3. search with depth limitation  
4. search with iterative deepening  
5. bidirectional search  

Stage 2. Informed search: (calculate path length)  

1. greedy search for the first best match
2. then, using information about the distance to the target in a straight line from each node, perform a search by minimizing the total score A*  

## Lab3

Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm  
Require:  

1. Using the mushroom dataset  
2. Randomly select five features in the dataset  
3. Implement building a decision tree without using third-party libraries  
4. Evaluate the implemented algorithm using Accuracy, precision and recall  
5. Build AUC-ROC and AUC-PR  

## Lab4

Using Neural Networks to deal with problems(Function and Dataset).  
There are 2 part of work, for each one you need to change given hyperparameters and try to reach max accuracy value.  

## Lab5

Purpose: to solve a multiclass classification problem using as a training dataset the MNIST dataset containing images of handwritten digits.  

1. Use principal component analysis for the MNIST dataset (train dataset of size 60000). Determine the minimum number of principal components that must be used in order for the proportion of explained variance to be greater than 0.80+list_number%10. Plot the percentage of explained variance versus the number of HAs used  
2. Enter the number of correctly classified objects of class number_in_list%9 for test data  
3. Enter the probability of assigning any 5 images from the test set to the assigned class  
4. Define Accuracy, Precision, Recall or F1 for the trained model  
5. Make a conclusion about the trained model
