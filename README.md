## Lab1

Compile a family tree base in the Prolog language, indicating kinship, based on two primary facts: parent and spouse.

What should be included in the report:

1. Task
2. Picture of family tree
3. The knowledge base must consist of at least 50 facts and at least 10 rules
4. Results of checking facts and rules on examples.

## Lab2

Investigate different search algorithms  
Connectivity table between known undirected graph cities  
Stage 1. Uninformed search: (ignore path length)  

1. breadth-first search  
2. search depth  
3. search with depth limitation  
4. search with iterative deepening  
5. bidirectional search  

Stage 2. Informed search: (calculate path length)  

1. greedy search for the first best match
2. then, using information about the distance to the target in a straight line from each node, perform a search by minimizing the total score A*  

## Lab3

Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm  
Require:  

1. Using the mushroom dataset  
2. Randomly select five features in the dataset  
3. Implement building a decision tree without using third-party libraries  
4. Evaluate the implemented algorithm using Accuracy, precision and recall  
5. Build AUC-ROC and AUC-PR  

## Lab4

Using Neural Networks to deal with problems(Function and Dataset).  
There are 2 part of work, for each one you need to change given hyperparameters and try to reach max accuracy value.  

## Neural Networks

Implemented NN and CNN algorithms in neural networks using pytorch
